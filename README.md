- This category involves simulations, various games, and problems where the main task is simply to implement a fiddly specification of some kind of process and find the outcome of it.

### Input (Input)

- This category is for problems that may involve non-trivial parsing of the input, irregular lines of input, or where the input is simply less structured than usual.

### Scaling (Scaling)

- Part Two scales up a variation of a problem from Part One n such as a way as to generally rule out brute-force or an obvious way of implementing it and so require a more clever solution.
